#Introduction
In this project, I demonstrate the process of setting up a database server on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). By configuring a database in this environment, I gain full control over the database setup, enabling extensive customization, performance tuning, and enhanced security measures. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications that require tailored database solutions, ensuring high availability and scalability. The project serves as a comprehensive guide for users interested in establishing their own database server on an Azure VM, covering everything from VM creation and database software installation to configuration steps and instructions for ensuring accessibility for authorized users.
